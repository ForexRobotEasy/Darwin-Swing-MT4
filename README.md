## How it Works

The main function of the software is to execute trading operations based on the calculated support and resistance levels, as well as other indicators and filters. 

1. Calculate Support and Resistance Levels: The software calculates the support and resistance levels for each forex pair using a custom calculation logic. The number of levels is determined for each symbol.

2. Place Virtual Positions: Virtual positions are placed based on the calculated support and resistance levels. This allows traders to simulate trading scenarios and test strategies without risking real money.

3. Open Real Positions: Real positions are opened when the price crosses the calculated support and resistance levels for each forex pair. This is done to take advantage of potential market movements and generate profits.

4. Multi-Currency Trading: The software enables trading on all 28 forex pairs simultaneously. This allows traders to diversify their portfolio and take advantage of various market opportunities.

5. Indicator and Filter Integration: The software integrates at least 8 indicators and filters into the trading strategy. These indicators and filters help in identifying market trends, potential entry and exit points, and filtering out false signals.

6. Currency Strength Calculation: The strength of a given currency is calculated using a custom algorithm. This information can be used to make informed trading decisions based on the relative strength of different currencies.
